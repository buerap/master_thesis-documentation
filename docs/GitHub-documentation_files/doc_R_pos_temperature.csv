ID_position,Identification number of the position,numeric,-,All the different observational units (n = 115 + MEHR). Used as connection element. Temperatures were measured 2-3cm below ground using temperature loggers (iButtons).
Temp_min,Annual minimum soil temperature,numeric,degree Celsius,Soil minimum temperature along the whole year (09.2019-09.2020).
Temp_max,Annual maximum soil temperature,numeric,degree Celsius,Soil maximum temperature along the whole year (09.2019-09.2020).
Temp_ampl,Annual soil temperature amplitude,numeric,Kelvin,Difference between annual soil minimum and maximum temperature (09.2019-09.2020).
Temp_ampl_max,Maximum of daily soil temperature amplitudes,numeric,Kelvin,"Maximum of all daily soil temperature amplitudes, which are differences between daily soil minimum and maximum temperatures (09.2019-09.2020)."
Temp_min_JS,Minimum soil temperature (June to Sept),numeric,degree Celsius,Soil minimum temperature in the time-span of 01.06.2020 until 01.09.2020.
Temp_min_snowfree,Minimum soil temperature (snowfree time),numeric,degree Celsius,"Soil minimum temperature in the time-span of one day after snow disappearance until 01.09.2020. Therefore, the position was already exposed to (potential) sun when experiencing this minimum temperature."
GDH.0_SS,Growing degree hours (> 0°C; Sept to Sept),numeric,degree hours,Growing heat summation of growing degree hours GDH (> 0°C) from 01.09.2019 to 01.09.2020. We used 2-hourly temperature measurements and multiplied them by 2 to get the unit of degree hours.
GDH.0_JA,Growing degree hours (> 0°C; July to Aug),numeric,degree hours,Growing heat summation of growing degree hours GDH (> 0°C) from 15.07.2020 to 15.08.2020. We used 2-hourly temperature measurements and multiplied them by 2 to get the unit of degree hours.
GDH.5_SS,Growing degree hours (> 5°C; Sept to Sept),numeric,degree hours,Growing heat summation of growing degree hours GDH (> 5°C) from 01.09.2019 to 01.09.2020. We used 2-hourly temperature measurements and multiplied them by 2 to get the unit of degree hours.
GDH.5_JA,Growing degree hours (> 5°C; July to Aug),numeric,degree hours,Growing heat summation of growing degree hours GDH (> 5°C) from 15.07.2020 to 15.08.2020. We used 2-hourly temperature measurements and multiplied them by 2 to get the unit of degree hours.
FDH.0_OA,Freezing degree hours (< 0°C; Oct to Aug),numeric,degree hours,Freezing summation of freezing degree hours FDH (< 0°C) from 01.10.2019 to 01.08.2020. We used 2-hourly temperature measurements and multiplied them by 2 to get the unit of degree hours.
wintersnow19_GMT,Snow-in time 2019,POSIXct,General mean time (GMT),Date and time when the position was snowed-in in autumn 2019.  Date and time determined using soil temperature curves of the loggers: Snow insulation --> constant 0°C.
